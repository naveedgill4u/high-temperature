    "text": "Description of the Image\nThis scatter plot illustrates the daily maximum temperatures in Seattle across the years 1979 to 2021. The x-axis represents the day of the year (1 through 365), and the y-axis denotes the maximum daily temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, ranging approximately from 20°F to 120°F.\nEach small gray dot corresponds to a single day’s maximum recorded temperature across this 43-year span, forming a seasonal arc that reflects Seattle’s annual temperature cycle:\nLower temperatures dominate the winter months (beginning and end of the year).\nHigher temperatures cluster in the mid-year, peaking in summer (June to August).\nAt the center-top of the plot, three large red dots stand out significantly above the rest of the distribution. These represent the exceptionally hot temperatures recorded over a three-day period, annotated with the bold red label “Last 3 days.”\nThe visual starkly emphasizes the extreme heat anomaly, as those red points sit well above the typical range for that time of year — a powerful visual cue highlighting how rare and unprecedented these temperatures were compared to historical records."
